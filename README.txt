A replicated main menu from the second episode of HL-2 Episode 2!
I wanted to learn how to add event listeners with sounds so I thought this would be the perfect exercise for it!
Some other things I learned during this exercise is How To:
-  Add a responsive background video to website
-  Replicate video game main menus in a creative way
-  Style HTML lists
-  Add sound effects on click and hover events
-  Change icons on click event
-  Create unique decorations for text elements

Original design by, Valve!
